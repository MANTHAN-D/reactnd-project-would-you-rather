# Would You Rather Project

## Description

This is React.js based web application that allows you to access collection of _would you rather_ questions as well as create their own. It allows users to track their score as compared to other registered users.

## Development

**Youâ€™ll need to have Node > 6 on your local development machine**. You can use [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#installation) (macOS/Linux) or [nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows#node-version-manager-nvm-for-windows) to easily switch Node versions between different projects.

To deploy this project to your local machine - Clone this repo to your dev box

```sh
cd path-to-project
```

Perform npm install or yarn install

```sh
npm install
```

OR

```sh
yarn install
```

To quickly start the server, run command:

```sh
npm start
```

OR

```sh
yarn run start
```

Then open the app at [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)

## Interaction

For default users as defined in [_DATA.js](src/utils/_DATA.js), password phrase is **password**.
